Welcome to MK's dev notes!
========================================

Hi coder, glad you're here.... 🙌

I'm Nithin MK, a self taught fullstack python developer.recently I came to notice that my browser bookmarks got really huge and I'm overwhelmed
with the scattered development notes. So I thought I'll keep a record  for my thoughts, notes, experiences and mistakes here.

What you can expect here 🤔..

I'm working mainly with Python and some Javascript (this will change as I'm working with different projects.)

Doc will be regularly updated, comments and corrections are most welcome.

I'm really grateful if it's helpful to anyone who is sitting in front of a computer with a scratching head.😇
